# vhdl-lecture-code

The VHDL code in this repository was written to go with a set of lecture slides. There are mistakes and discussion points in this code which are used in the lecture. Therefore, not all files will compile. Some will make efficent use of the FPGA others not.

The signal names do not follow a strict format again this is to make it easier in the lecture. 

Files are grouped by their lecture rather than function and are all pure *vhdl*.
